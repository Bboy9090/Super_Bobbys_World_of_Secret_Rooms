## Emergency Hotfix Procedure

If critical bug found after release:

1. **Assess Severity**
   - Is it security-critical?
   - Does it break core functionality?
   - Can users work around it?

2. **Quick Fix**
   - Create hotfix branch from tag: `git checkout -b hotfix/v1.x.1 v1.x.x`
   - Fix the bug
   - Test thoroughly
   - Bump PATCH version

3. **Emergency Release**
   - Follow abbreviated checklist:
     - [ ] Version bump
     - [ ] Build all platforms
     - [ ] Test fix works
     - [ ] Create tag
     - [ ] GitHub Release
     - [ ] Announce urgently

4. **Post-Hotfix**
   - Merge hotfix to main
   - Update documentation
   - Post-mortem: how to prevent similar issues

---

**Remember:** Quality over speed. It's better to delay a release than ship a buggy product.

**Good luck with the release!** 🚀
