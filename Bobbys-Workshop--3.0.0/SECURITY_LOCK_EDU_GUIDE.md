## Use Cases (Legitimate)

### Scenario 1: Forgot Google Account

**Problem**: User factory reset their own device but forgot Google password

**Solution**: Use Google Account Recovery process with security questions, backup email, or phone verification

**Problem**: Bought device from previous owner, still FRP-locked

**Solution**: Contact seller to remove account remotely via myaccount.google.com → Security → Manage Devices

### Scenario 3: Company Device After Leaving Job

**Problem**: Former employee with MDM-enrolled device

**Solution**: Return device to company IT department (it's company property)

### Scenario 4: Carrier-Locked Device

**Problem**: Switched carriers but device still locked

**Solution**: Contact original carrier, verify contract completion, request unlock code
