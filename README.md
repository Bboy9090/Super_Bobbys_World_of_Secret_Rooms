🍄 Super Bobby’s World: Warp Zones

A production-grade routing world for systems, states, and recovery paths.

Super Bobby’s World is a visual orchestration layer that represents real system intelligence as zones, warp pipes, and power states.
It looks like a game — but it behaves like infrastructure.

This platform does not execute risky operations itself.
It routes, observes, and coordinates trusted engines beneath it.

🌍 Core Idea

Every system is in a state.
Every state has paths.
Super Bobby’s World shows you those paths — clearly.
	•	Warp Pipes = execution routes
	•	Zones = system domains
	•	Power Stars = authorization & capability
	•	Coins = progress & signal
	•	Terminals = transparency

🧱 Architecture (Real, No Illusions)

Super Bobby’s World is production-ready, built on real infrastructure:
	•	🦀 Rust + Axum backend — fast, safe orchestration
	•	⚛️ React + TypeScript frontend — retro-inspired UI
	•	🐳 Docker Compose — one-command deployment
	•	🔐 Feature-gated execution — nothing runs accidentally
	•	📜 Audit-first design — every action is traceable

No fake success.
No silent execution.
No hidden automation.

🗺️ The 9 Warp Zones
	1.	Boot Zone — startup & boot states
	2.	Device Zone — connected hardware

	4.	Power Zone — authority & capability
	5.	Signal Zone — communication & events
	6.	Shadow Zone — hidden / restricted paths
	7.	Forge Zone — repair & recovery routing
	8.	Chaos Zone — undefined or unstable states
	9.	Core Zone — Phoenix Core & system truth
