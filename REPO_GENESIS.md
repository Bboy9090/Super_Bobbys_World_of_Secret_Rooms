# REFORGE OS — REPO GENESIS

**Status: AUTHORITATIVE**

This file is the constitution of REFORGE OS. Anything in this file overrides defaults, assumptions, or simplifications.

---

## 0. WHAT THIS REPO IS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This repository is the fusion of three legendary systems into one platform:

### Bobby's Workshop
→ Brand, culture, UX, trust, community, training

### Pandora's Codex
→ Internal, permissioned, R&D knowledge vault (NEVER PUBLIC)

### ForgeWorks / Compliance-First Repair Platform
→ Legal, auditable, regulator-safe analysis & recovery routing core

**Together, this is:**

**REFORGE OS** (Bobby's Workshop 3.0)
A compliance-first, ownership-respecting, audit-logged platform that analyzes, interprets, and routes lawful device recovery—without executing circumvention.

This is a **platform, not a tool**. It must survive laws tightening, vendors changing, and exploits dying.

---

## 1. ABSOLUTE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### ❌ NEVER
- Execute bypass, jailbreak, root, unlock, or circumvention
- Provide exploit instructions, binaries, scripts, or automation
- Document "how-to" for defeating safeguards
- Automate any modification actions

### ✅ ALWAYS
- Analyze over action
- Interpret over execution
- Route to authority over bypass
- Ownership, consent, jurisdiction, and auditability first

**Power is preserved as judgment, not action.**

---

## 2. THE THREE LAYERS (KEEP THEM SEPARATE)

### LAYER 1 — BOBBY'S WORKSHOP (PUBLIC)

**Purpose**: Trust, Education, UX, Community, Repair Intelligence, Reports

**Allowed**:
- Device analysis dashboards
- Legal classifications
- Guided repair intelligence (non-circumventing)
- Customer-facing transparency
- Certification & training
- Documentation

**Never Allowed**:
- Any execution of grey or restricted actions
- Any reference to internal Pandora logic

### LAYER 2 — FORGEWORKS CORE (PUBLIC + ENTERPRISE)

**Purpose**: Compliance spine, Device status evaluation, Ownership verification, Jurisdiction-aware legal classification, Audit logging, External authority routing

**Key Principle**: ForgeWorks never does. ForgeWorks decides and documents.

**Outputs**:
- Compliance reports (PDF)
- Risk classifications
- Authorization checklists
- OEM / carrier / court routing guidance

### LAYER 3 — PANDORA CODEX (INTERNAL ONLY)

**Purpose**: R&D, Historical exploit knowledge, Grey-zone understanding, Risk modeling inputs

**STRICT RULE**: Pandora Codex MUST NEVER SHIP.

**It may**:
- Inform classification logic
- Influence risk scoring
- Shape interpretive language

**It may NEVER**:
- Surface steps
- Surface tools
- Surface instructions
- Surface automation

**Pandora Codex is wisdom, not capability.**

---

## 3. BOBBY'S SECRET ROOM (FINAL FORM)

**Name (LOCKED)**: Bobby's Secret Room™ — The Custodian Vault

**Mode**: Interpretive (Analysis-Only)

### What It Is
A legal, ethical, logged interpretive environment used only for scenarios with legal ambiguity. Requires ownership + authorization + acknowledgment.

### What It Does
- Classifies legality
- Maps precedent
- Identifies required external authority
- Generates compliance documentation

### What It NEVER Does
- Execute actions
- Provide instructions
- Link binaries
- Automate anything

**Every interaction is logged.**

---

## 4. HOW TO PROCESS LARGE INSTRUCTION DUMPS (CRITICAL)

When given large text, AI/humans MUST:

1. **Ingest everything** as authoritative
2. **Identify multiple jobs** hidden in the text
3. **Separate jobs** into clusters:
   - Legal
   - UX
   - Architecture
   - Governance
   - Branding
   - Internal-only knowledge
4. **Preserve all intent**
5. **Resolve conflicts** using this priority:
   - Compliance > Auditability > Ownership > Power
6. **Synthesize** into ONE unified system

**No early summaries. No deletions.**

---

## 5. WHAT SHIPS VS WHAT NEVER SHIPS

### ✅ SHIPS
- Legal language
- Taxonomy
- Classification logic
- Reports
- Audit logs
- Education
- Routing guidance
- UI/UX copy
- Certification systems

### ❌ NEVER SHIPS
- Exploit chains
- Bypass workflows
- Tool instructions
- Automation
- "Slightly dirty" execution logic
- Paid bypass integrations

**If it executes, it doesn't belong.**

---

## 6. TONE & UX LANGUAGE RULES

### ✅ Use
- "Analyze"
- "Interpret"
- "Classify"
- "Route"
- "External authorization required"
- "Logged for compliance"

### ❌ Never Use
- "Bypass"
- "Unlock"
- "Supported exploit"
- "Works on"
- "Apply"

**Language is legal armor.**

---

## 7. AUDITABILITY IS MANDATORY

Every action must:
- Be attributable
- Be timestamped
- Be immutable
- Be exportable

**No silent paths. Ever.**

---

## 8. THIS REPO'S END GOAL

The final state of this repo is:

- One platform
- One narrative
- One governance model
- Three layers
- Zero illegal execution
- Maximum long-term power

**Others chase tools. This repo defines the frame.**

---

## 9. FINAL DIRECTIVE TO AI/HUMANS

You are not here to simplify.
You are here to forge.

**Do not**:
- Ask questions
- Remove intent
- Collapse layers

**Build REFORGE OS exactly as defined above.**

---

## ✅ THIS FILE IS CANON

**If something conflicts with this file, this file wins.**
