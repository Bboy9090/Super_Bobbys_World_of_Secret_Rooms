# REFORGE OS — Unified Platform Overview

**Complete Synthesis of All Source Repositories**

This document provides the complete overview of REFORGE OS, synthesized from:
- Bobby's Workshop
- Bobby's Workshop 3.0
- BootForge USB
- Palera1n (knowledge base only)

## What REFORGE OS Is

REFORGE OS is a **compliance-first, hardware-anchored platform** that unifies device diagnostics, repair intelligence, and lawful recovery routing.

**Platform Name**: REFORGE OS  
**Hardware Line**: Workshop Forge™  
**Software Core**: ForgeWorks Core  
**Internal Vault**: Pandora Codex (internal only)

---

## Core Principle

> **We do not circumvent safeguards.**  
> **We interpret ownership, law, and recovery pathways—then route to authority.**

## The Three Layers

### Layer 1: Bobby's Workshop (Public)

**From Sources**:
- Bobby's Workshop UI/UX
- Dashboard designs

### Layer 2: ForgeWorks Core (Compliance Spine)

**From Sources**:
- BootForge USB enumeration core
- Platform orchestration layer
- Device analysis services
- Legal compliance framework

**Purpose**: Device analysis, ownership verification, legal classification, audit logging

**Technology**:

## Bobby's Secret Room™ — The Custodian Vault

**Mode**: Interpretive (Analysis-Only)

**Access Requirements**:
- Enterprise tier or higher
- Verified identity
- Proof of ownership/authorization
- Hardware serial match
- Permanent audit logging

**Functions**:
- Legal ambiguity classification
- Precedent mapping
- External authority identification
- Compliance documentation generation

**NEVER**:

## What Ships vs. What Never Ships

### ✅ SHIPS (Public)

- Legal language
- Device analysis tools
- Classification logic
- Reports
- Audit logs (user's own)
