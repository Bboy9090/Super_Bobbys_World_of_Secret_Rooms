# PANDORA CODEX — INTERNAL CHARTER

**STATUS: INTERNAL ONLY — NEVER SHIPS**

---

## 🔒 NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

### What Pandora Codex Is

- **Knowledge vault** for risk modeling
- **Historical context** for interpretation
- **Classification intelligence** for legal assessment
- **Precedent mapping** for jurisdiction awareness

### What Pandora Codex Is NOT

- ❌ Execution engine
- ❌ Instruction manual
- ❌ Binary repository
- ❌ Automation system
- ❌ Public-facing content

---

## Access Control

### Tier 1: Enterprise
- Risk classification access
- Historical context (abstract)
- No specific tool references

### Tier 2: Research
- Full knowledge index
- Tool classifications
- Precedent mapping
- **Still no execution**

### Tier 3: Institutional
- Complete access
- All knowledge domains
- Custom classification models
- **Execution remains forbidden**

---

## One-Way Data Flow

```
Pandora Codex
    ↓ (risk models, classifications ONLY)
ForgeWorks Core
    ↓ (analysis, reports ONLY)
Bobby's Workshop UI
    ↓ (user-facing interpretation)
```

**NEVER REVERSE. NEVER DIRECT ACCESS.**

## Content Classification

### All Knowledge Must Be:

1. **Abstract**: Category-level, not step-by-step
2. **Historical**: Context for understanding, not instruction
3. **Risk-focused**: What to be aware of, not how to do it
4. **Jurisdiction-aware**: Legal context, not execution paths

### Forbidden Content:

- Specific exploit steps
- Tool operation sequences
- Bypass workflows
- Automation scripts
- Binary references

---

## Audit Requirements

- All access logged
- All queries timestamped
- All exports require authorization
- No silent reads

---

## Integration Points

Pandora Codex informs:
- Risk scoring algorithms
- Legal classification thresholds
- Language guardrails
- Precedent warnings

Pandora Codex does NOT provide:
- Execution logic
- Tool instructions
- Automation triggers
- Direct user access

**This charter is immutable. Violation = immediate access revocation.**
