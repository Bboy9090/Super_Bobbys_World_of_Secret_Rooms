# REFORGE OS — Platform Overview

## What We Are

REFORGE OS is a compliance-first analysis platform for lawful device recovery, repair intelligence, and ownership-respecting analysis.

## What We Are Not

- ❌ We do not execute or automate circumvention
- ❌ We do not provide exploit instructions
- ❌ We do not link to executable tools
- ❌ We do not store device contents or credentials

## Platform Architecture

### Layer 1 — Bobby's Workshop (Public)
- Trust, education, UX, community
- Device analysis dashboards
- Legal classifications
- Guided repair intelligence (non-circumventing)

### Layer 2 — ForgeWorks Core (Compliance Spine)
- Device status evaluation
- Ownership verification
- Jurisdiction-aware legal classification
- Audit logging
- External authority routing

### Layer 3 — Pandora Codex (Internal)
- Permissioned R&D knowledge vault
- NEVER SHIPPED
- Informs classification logic only

## Core Principle

> We do not circumvent safeguards.  
> We interpret ownership, law, and recovery pathways—then route to authority.

## Why This Reduces Harm

- Ownership verification gates
- Risk disclosure
- External authority routing
- Immutable audit logs
- Compliance-first design
