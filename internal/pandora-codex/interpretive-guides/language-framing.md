# LANGUAGE FRAMING GUIDE

**INTERNAL ONLY — How to Talk About Tools Without Instructing**

---

## Core Principle

**Never tell users HOW.**
**Always explain WHAT IT MEANS.**

---

## Framing Rules

### ✅ ALLOWED Language

"Device analysis indicates potential use of [tool category]"
"Historical data suggests this device state may be related to [classification]"
"Legal classification for this scenario is [status] based on [precedent]"
"Ownership verification required before proceeding with analysis"
"External authority routing recommended for this classification"

### ❌ FORBIDDEN Language

"Use [tool] to [action]"
"Run [command] to [result]"
"Download [tool] from [location]"
"Follow these steps:"
"Execute [tool] with [parameters]"

---

## Tool Category Framing

### Instead of Naming Tools Directly

❌ "This device was jailbroken with Palera1n"
✅ "Device analysis indicates hardware-level modification consistent with Checkm8-class exploit usage"

❌ "Use Magisk to root this device"
✅ "Device classification flags systemless modification scenarios that may require authorization"

❌ "FRP can be bypassed with UnlockTool"
✅ "FRP lock scenarios require ownership verification and may route to OEM/carrier authorization pathways"

---

## Risk Communication Framing

### High Risk Scenarios

✅ "This device state indicates high-risk modification category requiring ownership verification and authorization"
❌ "This device is jailbroken/rooted and requires bypass"

### Authorization Requirements

✅ "External authority routing required: [OEM/Carrier/Court]"
❌ "You need [tool] to fix this"

---

## Legal Classification Framing

### Permitted Scenarios

✅ "Legal classification: Permitted with ownership verification"
❌ "Legal to jailbreak/root"

### Prohibited Scenarios

✅ "Legal classification: Prohibited. External authority routing required"
❌ "Illegal to bypass"

### Conditionally Permitted

✅ "Legal classification: Conditionally permitted. Authorization from [authority] required"
❌ "Legal if you have [tool/license]"

---

## Precedent Reference Framing

### How to Reference Historical Context

✅ "Historical precedent indicates this category requires [authorization type]"
✅ "Legal framework for this classification includes [abstract precedent reference]"
❌ "Case [X] shows how to [action]"
❌ "Precedent [Y] allows [specific tool usage]"

---

## Device State Communication

### Analysis Results Framing

✅ "Device analysis indicates: [abstract classification]"
✅ "Security state classification: [category]"
✅ "Capability assessment: [risk level]"
❌ "Device is [specific tool state]"
❌ "Tool [X] was used on this device"

---

## Route to Authority Framing

### OEM Routing

✅ "OEM authorization pathway identified. Contact [OEM] service program"
❌ "Use [OEM tool] to unlock"

### Carrier Routing

✅ "Carrier unlock eligibility assessment available. Route to carrier unlock process"
❌ "Bypass carrier lock with [tool]"

### Court Order Routing

✅ "Legal authorization required. Court order process initiated"
❌ "Get court order to unlock"

---

## Audit Log Framing

✅ "All analysis operations logged for compliance"
✅ "Audit trail available for regulatory review"
❌ "Tool usage logged"
❌ "Bypass operations recorded"

---

**Remember: We classify and route. We never instruct or execute.**
